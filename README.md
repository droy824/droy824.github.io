## About
Hi! I'm an aspiring researcher focused on **computer vision**, with research experience in **computational
photography** and **crime detection**, project experience in **3D biomedical imagery**, and work experience at experience at Stripe. Skilled in **2D/3D computer vision**,
**federated learning**, and **generative modeling** through hands-on research and implementations.

## Education
- B.E. Computer Science | Birla Institute of Technology and Science
- Relevant Coursework: Generative AI, Introduction to LLMs, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics

## Experience
- ### Research on Computational Photography using Federated Learning (Aug. 2024 – May 2025)
  Research under [Prof. Pratik Narang](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/pratik-narang/) related to augmenting computational photography tasks, specifically denoising, with federated learning techniques to solve the problem of limited noisy-clean image pair data. During this project, I worked on training and evaluating established approaches like DnCNN, DBSN, and Blind2Unblind on custom noise models in federated setups.

- ### Research on Crime Detection in Surveillance Videos (Nov. 2023 – May 2024)
  Worked on the task of detecting and classifying 10 crime types in the UCF-Crime dataset using YOLOv3 and DeepSORT. We preprocessed 1000+ videos, then designed, trained, and tuned an LSTM model, achieving an AUC score of 62.5%, approaching state-of-the-art performance.
